# Pitch shifting using DFT

This exercise shows the implementation of the pitch shifting technique in the frequency domain. As the pitch is strongly related to frequencies, it may become very clear what happens while shifting the pitch of a sound. Moreover, the implementation is easy to understand thanks to the existing functions of Fourier Transform and its inverse. 

The [Section 6.1](theory.md) explains the theory behind this technique, and in [Section 6.2](implementation.md) you will be guided through the implementation of the DFT pitch shifting in Python which is similar to the [Granular Synthesis](granular-synthesis.md) implementation. This will give you an intuition for the implementation of the same code in C.

As before, the highlighted boxes below mean that _you_ must find the appropriate solution and implementation.
