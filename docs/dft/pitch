# Pitch shifting using DFT

In this tutorial, we will implement a pitch shifting using DFT. 

The relation between pitch and frequency is not straightforward: while the frequency is an objective value that can be measured, the pitch is a subjective perception of sound. However, a *definite* pitch, i.e. a pitch that can be easily discerned, has a harmonic frequency spectra: all present frequencies are multiples of the first one, which is called *fundamental* frequency. What we hear is the fundamental frequency; its multiples are called *partials*, and serve to give a particular timbre. Here is an example of a G# played on cello:
