# INTRODUCTION

Hi, and welcome to this final module of the DSP course, in which we will learn how to implement real time algorithms on a general-purpose microcontroller unit. While the theory behind our algorithms will not change, the constraints imposed by a low-power CPU will demand that we pay particular attention to implementation details such as code efficiency, memory use and input/output routines.

The skills and the experience needed to port a real-time signal processing algorithm to an embedded board are the province of the truly accomplished DSP engineers; in this module you will be able to get a first taste of the challenges and the struggles of the job, together with the priceless satisfaction of truly "making" a device come to life.

In this online book we will provide you with step-by-step instructions together with links to videos on Coursera that illustrate all the steps leading to the "finished product", so to speak. Working with hardware can often prove overwhelming and dealing with the numerous protocols, lengthy documentation, and specific components can be frustrating at times. But, thanks to these notes and the videos, you should be able to navigate around these issues with ease and taste the fun and exciting side of practical DSP right away.

Even if you don't have access to the recommended hardware, you will still be able to appreciate the main lessons simply using Python on your PC. In this case, you can skip ahead to [Chapter 3](alien-voice/), but we do recommend you read [Section 2.1](passthrough/audio-io/) on Audio I/O theory.

We hope you'll find this tutorial instructive and entertaining!
