# INTRODUCTION

In this online book, we provide step-by-step instructions for the hands-on exercises of the EPFL course: [COM-303, Signal processing for communications](http://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!itffichecours.htm?ww_i_matiere=24007074&ww_x_anneeacad=1866893861&ww_i_section=944590&ww_i_niveau=6683147&ww_c_langue=en). The purpose of these exercises is to provide first-hand experience \(and valuable struggles\) in the practical sides of Digital Signal Processing \(DSP\).

Working with hardware can often be frustrating and overwhelming with the numerous protocols, lengthy documentations, and seemingly competing components. With these exercises, we hope to ease you into the fun and exciting side of DSP!

If you are not a student at EPFL, feel free to use the material from these exercises and let us know if you spot any points for improvement! You can do so by checking out the [repository](https://github.com/LCAV/dsp-labs) for this online book.

Even if you can't get the [hardware](https://lcav.gitbook.io/dsp-labs/bom) for these exercises, the main lessons in DSP can still be acquired in Python with your laptop! In this case, you can skip ahead to [Chapter 3](alien-voice/README.md), but we do recommend reading [Section 2.1](passthrough/audio-io/README.md) on Audio I/O theory.
