# 2.4 Coding passthrough

UPDATED BY AH

In this section, we will guide you through programming the microcontroller in order to implement the passthrough! In the previous section, you should have copied the blinking LED project before updating the IOC file with CubeMX. From the SW4STM32 software, open the file `"Src/main.c"` in the new project; we will be making all of our modifications here.

## Muting the DAC <a id="mute_macro"></a>

We will start off by creating _macros_ to change the logical level of the **MUTE** pin. See [here](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/cpreprocessor.html) for more on macros and preprocessor commands \(we will also be defining constants\).

Macros are usually defined at the top of a `main` program; we will place our macros between the `USER CODE BEGIN Includes` and `USER CODE END Includes` comments.

As in the blinking LED example, we will be using the same HAL library in order to modify the state of the **MUTE** GPIO pin.

{% hint style="info" %}
TASK 9: Define two macros - `MUTE` and `UNMUTE` - in order to mute/unmute the output. See below for the necessary syntax.

Use syntax like below, replacing `GPIO_PIN_SET_OR_RESET` with the appropriate value.

_Hint: you should check the_ [_datasheet of the DAC_](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/UDA1334ATS.pdf) _to determine whether you need a HIGH \(_`GPIO_PIN_SET`_\) or LOW \(_`GPIO_PIN_RESET`_\) value to turn on the mute function of the DAC._
{% endhint %}

```c
#define MUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET_OR_RESET);
#define UNMUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET_OR_RESET);
```

Note how the **MUTE** pin we configured before automatically generated two _constants_ called `MUTE_GPIO_Port` and `MUTE_Pin`, which is why we suggested giving meaningful names to pins configured with the CubeMX tool.

If you press "Ctrl" \("Command" on MacOS\) + click on `MUTE_GPIO_Port` or `MUTE_Pin` to see its definition, you should see how the values are defined according to the pin we selected for **MUTE**. In our case, we chose pin **PC0** which means that _Pin 0_ on the _GPIO C_ port will be used. The convenience of the CubeMX software is that we do not need to manually write these definitions for the constants! The same can be observed for **LR\_SEL**.

## Setting microphone as _left_ or _right_ channel <a id="channel_macro"></a>

We will now define two more macros in order to set the microphone to the left or right channel of the I2S bus, using the **LR\_SEL** pin we defined. As before, you should place these macros between the `USER CODE BEGIN Includes` and `USER CODE END Includes` comments.

{% hint style="info" %}
TASK 10: Define two macros - `SET_MIC_RIGHT` and `SET_MIC_LEFT` - in order to set the microphone to the left or right channel. You will need to use similar commands as for the **MUTE** macros!

_Hint: you should check the_ [_I2S protocol_](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/BreakoutBoards/I2SBUS.pdf) _\(and perhaps the_ [_datasheet of the microphone_](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/product-files/3421/i2S+Datasheet.PDF)_\) to determine whether you need a HIGH or LOW value to set the microphone to the left/right channel._
{% endhint %}

## Private variables <a id="constants"></a>

The following code should be placed between the `USER CODE BEGIN PV` and `USER CODE END PV` comments.

### Common DSP parameters

We will now define a few constants which will be useful in coding our application. Before defining them in our code, let's clarify some of the terminology we will be using:

1. _Sample_: A single sample represents the value of a **single** channel at a certain point in time.
2. _Frame_: A frame consists of exactly one sample per channel.
3. _Buffer length_: This is a key parameter that often needs to be tuned to one's application. DSP applications are typically performed on multiple frames; this collection of frames is called a _buffer_. A large buffer length \(the number of frames\) allows one to apply more complex processing \(e.g. better frequency resolution by applying a larger FFT\). However, a large buffer length comes with the cost of more _latency_ as we need to wait for more samples for each channel before we can begin processing.

Add the following lines to define the frame length \(in terms of samples\) and the buffer length \(in terms of frames\):

```c
#define SAMPLE_PER_FRAME 2
#define FRAME_PER_BUFFER 32
```

`SAMPLE_PER_FRAME` is set to 2 as we have two input channels \(left and right\) as per the I2S protocol.

As our application is a simple passthrough, which involves no processing, we can set the buffer length - `FRAME_PER_BUFFER` - to a low value, e.g. 32.

### Storing samples

Finally, we need to store the incoming samples into an array, and while we receive these new samples we do not want to tamper any samples we might still be processing. The I2S peripheral of our microcontroller has the nice feature of sending _interruptions_ at two critical state of its operation. The first is simply when the buffer is full. However they added a second interruption for when the buffer is half full. More on this is explained [below](coding.md#dma) in the "DMA callback functions" section.

In this way we will use an array that is _twice_ the size of our application's buffer, i.e. the size of our buffer in terms of samples. With this solution, we can place new samples on one half of the buffer while we simultaneously process samples on the other half of the buffer.

{% hint style="info" %}
TASK 11: Using the constants defined before - `SAMPLE_PER_FRAME` and `FRAME_PER_BUFFER` - define two more constants for the buffer size and for the size of the double buffer.

_Hint: replace_ `USING_FRAME_PER_BUFFER_AND_SAMPLE_PER_FRAME` _below with the appropriate expression._
{% endhint %}

```c
#define BUFFER_SIZE (USING_FRAME_PER_BUFFER_AND_SAMPLE_PER_FRAME)
#define DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S (2*BUFFER_SIZE)
```

Finally, we can create the input and output buffers as such:

```c
int16_t dataIn[DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S];
int16_t dataOut[DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S];
```

## Private function prototypes <a id="callback"></a>

The following code will be placed between the `USER CODE BEGIN PFP` and `USER CODE END PFP` comments.

### Main processing function

It is now time to actually process the samples! As a simple solution, we will simply copy the input buffer into the output buffer. This processing will be done in the I2S-triggered interrupt callbacks, which happens every time either the first or the second half of the buffer is full.

We will declare our `process` function as such:

```c
void process(int16_t *bufferInStereo, int16_t *bufferOutStereo, uint16_t size);
```

Our `process` function will take as input:

1. Two pointers: one to the input buffer to process and one to the output buffer to place the processed samples.
2. The number of samples to read/write.

### DMA callback functions <a id="dma"></a>

As previously mentioned, the STM32 board uses DMA \(direct memory access\) to offload the main chip from the tasks of transferring data in and out of memory. This is incredibly important for audio as we will have very frequent transfer from the I2S data line of the microphone to memory and from memory to the I2S data line of the DAC. With DMA, our main chip can focus on processing the audio!

The HAL family of instructions allows us the define [callback functions](https://www.reddit.com/r/DSP/comments/53t2k3/whats_an_audio_callback_function/). In these functions we will take care of processing the audio. Add the following function definitions for the callbacks we will be using:

```c
void HAL_I2S_RxHalfCpltCallback(I2S_HandleTypeDef *hi2s) {
}

void HAL_I2S_RxCpltCallback(I2S_HandleTypeDef *hi2s) {
}

void HAL_I2S_TxHalfCpltCallback(I2S_HandleTypeDef *hi2s) {
    process(dataIn, dataOut, BUFFER_SIZE);
}

void HAL_I2S_TxCpltCallback(I2S_HandleTypeDef *hi2s) {
    process(&dataIn[BUFFER_SIZE], &dataOut[BUFFER_SIZE], BUFFER_SIZE);
}
```

For the receive callbacks, we will not be performing any processing; instead we will use our `process` function before transmitting, i.e. sending the data to the DAC. It is a way of synchronizing the input and the output peripheral. We can see here that if the `process` function is too long, the buffer will not be ready in time for the next callback and there will be audio losses. In the next chapter, we will introduce a mechanism to monitor this.

You can read more about the HAL functions for DMA Input/Output for the I2S protocol in the comments of the file `"Drivers/STM32F0XX_HAL_Driver/Src/stm32f0xx_hal_i2s.c"` from the SW4STM32 software:

## Passthrough code <a id="main"></a>

Between the `USER CODE BEGIN 4` and `USER CODE END 4` comments, we will define our function `process` which will implement a simple passthrough.

```c
void inline process(int16_t *bufferInStereo, int16_t *bufferOutStereo, uint16_t size) {
    // Strictly copying input to output
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        // Here copy input buffer to output buffer
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
TASK 12: Use the two buffers - `bufferInStereo` and `bufferOutStereo` - in the loop above in order to realize a passthrough.

_Hint: you just need to add one line! In C, you have to manipulate one element at a time, using_ `[` _and_ `]` _to index the array._
{% endhint %}

### Setup code

Between the `USER CODE BEGIN 2` and `USER CODE END 2` comments, we need to initialize our STM32 board, namely:

1. Un-muting the DAC using the macro defined [here](coding.md#mute_macro).
2. Setting the microphone to either left or right channel using the macro defined [here](coding.md#channel_macro).
3. Instigating the receive and transmit DMAs with `HAL_I2S_Receive_DMA` and `HAL_I2S_Transmit_DMA` respectively.

Add the following lines:

```c
// Control of the codec
UNMUTE
SET_MIC_LEFT

// begin DMAs
HAL_I2S_Transmit_DMA(&hi2s1, (uint16_t *) dataOut, DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S);
HAL_I2S_Receive_DMA(&hi2s2, (uint16_t *) dataIn, DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S);
```

We can now try building and debugging the project \(remember to press _Resume_ after entering the Debug perspective\). If all goes well, you should have successfully built a passthrough!

## Going a bit further

If you still have time and you are curious to go a bit further, we propose to make a modification to the `process` function. Depending on your current implementation, you may have noticed that only one output channel consists of audio. Wouldn't it be nice if both had audio?

_Note: remember to copy your project before making any significant modifications; that way you will always be able to go back to a stable solution!_

{% hint style="info" %}
BONUS: Modify the `process` function so that both output channels contain audio.
{% endhint %}

```c
void inline process(int16_t *bufferInStereo, int16_t *bufferOutStereo, uint16_t size) {
    // Strictly copying input to output
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        // Here copy either left or right channel to both output channels
    }
}
```

**Congrats on completeting the passthrough! This project will serve as an extremely useful starting point for the following \(more interesting\) applications. The first one we will build is an** [_**alien voice effect**_](../alien-voice/)**.**

## Tasks solutions

{% tab title="Anti-spoiler tab" %}
Are you sure you are ready to see the solution? ;\)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Task 9" %}
Here you are asked to modify the macros and change the string

```c
GPIO_PIN_SET_OR_RESET
```

to be either

```c
GPIO_PIN_SET
```

or

```c
GPIO_PIN_RESET
```

The table 6 section 8.6.3 of the DAC [datasheet](https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/UDA1334ATS.pdf) sais: LOW = mute off, HIGH = mute on.  
We will thus define the following macros:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */

#define MUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET);
#define UNMUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

/* USER CODE END Includes */
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Task 10" %}
In the same way as we did for the DAC, we will look in the microphone datasheet. the information we are looking for in on page 6 of the datasheet: _The Tri-state Control \(gray\) uses the state of the WS and SELECT inputs to determine if the DATA pin is driven or tri-stated. This allows 2 microphones to operate on a single I2S port. When SELECT =HIGH the DATA pin drives the SDIN bus when WS=HIGH otherwise DATA= tri-state. When SELECT =LOW the DATA pin drives the SDIN bus when WS=LOW otherwise DATA= tri-state._ As the WS pin is LOW when the left signal is transmitted \(cf. fig. 5 of the DAC datasheet\), we will define the macro as following:

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN Includes */

#define MUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET);
#define UNMUTE HAL_GPIO_WritePin(MUTE_GPIO_Port, MUTE_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

#define SET_MIC_RIGHT HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LR_SEL_GPIO_Port, LR_SEL_Pin, GPIO_PIN_SET);
#define SET_MIC_LEFT HAL_GPIO_WritePin(LR_SEL_GPIO_Port, LR_SEL_Pin, GPIO_PIN_RESET);

/* USER CODE END Includes */
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Task 11" %}
The calculus is quite trivial here, we will make a quick recap:  
A sample is "a value at a certain time for one channel"  
A frame is "the package of a left and a right sample"  
Thus the buffer has in our case the length SAMPLE\_PER\_FRAME x FRAME\_PER\_BUFFER, as every sample has 16 bits \(1 half-word\) a buffer will be 32x2 half-words long.

The double buffer size is then 128 values.

```c
/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
#define SAMPLE_PER_FRAME 2      // L+R
#define FRAME_PER_BUFFER 32     // user-choice, depends on application
#define BUFFER_SIZE (FRAME_PER_BUFFER*SAMPLE_PER_FRAME)
#define DOUBLE_BUFFER_I2S (2*BUFFER_SIZE)
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Task 12" %}
The pass-through is made by copying the input buffer on the output buffer. This is done so:

```c
void inline process(int16_t *bufferInStereo, int16_t *bufferOutStereo, uint16_t size) {
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        bufferOutStereo[i] = bufferInStereo[i];
    }
}
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Bonus" %}
There is alway several way to the same goal in C, however we propose you the following solution:

```c
void inline process(int16_t *bufferInStereo, int16_t *bufferOutStereo, uint16_t size) {
    for (uint16_t i = 0; i < size; i+=2) {
        bufferOutStereo[i] = bufferInStereo[i];
        bufferOutStereo[i+1] = bufferInStereo[i];
    }
}
```

In this way the value of the microphone, that is only on one side \(every second channel\) will be copied to both side of the output buffer.

Be careful that it will only work of you set your microphone on the left channel, you might imagine a more elaborated code if you want to adapt to the SET\_MIC\_LEFT/SET\_MIC\_RIGHT macro.
