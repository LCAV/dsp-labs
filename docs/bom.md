# BILL OF MATERIALS

The following materials are needed:

* [STM32 NUCLEO-F072RB](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html)
* [USB cable - 6" A/MiniB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/899)
* [Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3421)
* [Adafruit I2S Stereo Decoder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3678)
* [Jumper Wires](https://www.adafruit.com/product/266)

In principle, any board from STM32 can be used for these exercises, as long as it is supported by [CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html), [System Workbench](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html), and supports at least two I2S buses.
