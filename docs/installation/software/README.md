# 1.2 Software

STMicroelectronics has provided a complete IDE that includes a code generation software. Previously called _System Workbench for STM32_ and _STM32CubeMX_, both software are now integrated in one single software that is called [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html). It is based on Eclipse so you might be familiar with how it looks.

* [**STM32CubeIDE**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html): an Eclipse-based IDE for programming STM32 microcontrollers. See [here](sw4stm32.md) for installation instructions.

* [**CubeMX**](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html): a graphical software configuration tool, included in STM32CubeIDE, that simplifies the process of generating the C initialization code for STM32 microcontrollers.
