_Note: these instruction and images were produced on February 6, 2018 and last verified on July 23, 2018._

The following steps are the same for Windows, Linux, and MacOS as they simply consist of downloading the installation files. For the actual installation process, please refer to the corresponding subsection **after performing the following six steps:**

1\) Navigate to the ST [site for the STM32CubeMX software](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html).

2\) At the bottom of the page, you should find a link to download the software. Press the button "Get Software".

3\) A License Agreement should pop up. In order to download the software, it is required to accept the agreement.

4\) If you have an ST account and are logged in, the software should download automatically. Otherwise, a pop-up will appear asking for you to make an account. You can make an account by pressing the "Login/Register" button. However, this process will take you to another page and ask you to provide additional details such as "Function", "Company", "Industry", "Country", and "Zip/Postcode". _Alternatively_, you can just enter "First name", "Last name", and "Email" in the pop-up \(see below\). Accept the "Sales Terms & Conditions", "Privacy Policy" and "Terms of Use" and press the "Download" button.

5\) You should then receive an email \(see below\) with a link to both validate your email address and start the download. The download should be a ZIP file with a title similar to `"en.stm32cubemx.zip"`. Place the file in a desired location and unzip it.
