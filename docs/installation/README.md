# 1. OVERVIEW AND INSTALLATION

First things first, we will go over the hardware and the associated software tools.

We will use a board manufactured by STMicroelectronics \(often abbreviated as ST\). ST provides many development boards that are used by hobbyists, students, and even professionals to prototype countless applications. In this module, we will connect the ST board to a microphone as an input source and to a digital-to-analog converter \(DAC\) as an output sink. We will describe these devices and our ST board in [Section 1.1](hardware.md).

In order to facilitate the development of applications, ST partners with third-party software companies that develop integrated development environments \(IDEs\) for their boards. These tools can sometimes be overwhelming as they allow for a lot of customization, but they are meant to make your life easier! Attention to detail and reading the documentation will help you in setting up a successful workflow. Details about these tools and their installation will be covered in [Section 1.2](software/).

Finally, in [Section 1.3](instructions.md), we will combine the hardware and software to build our first project!
